In this level u need to get the text from file01 & file02 first.
Combine two text together and use base64 decode it,
Run shell script and insert the value u just got from base64.

the command u may need in this level: cat cd ls grep base64

NOTE: u can easily type in ./shell.sh to run the shell script.
